  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 92,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (28/30): The predicates accurately represent the essential properties: taxi and person locations, taxi occupancy, and person-in-taxi status. Minor deduction for not modeling taxi capacity beyond 'empty', which may limit extensibility for multiple passengers. Actions (33/35): The actions logically model movement, pickup, and dropoff, with sensible preconditions and effects that match common sense (e.g., taxi and person must be co-located for pickup). Slight deduction for not handling edge cases like attempting to pick up when not empty or moving with passengers. Sufficiency (31/35): The domain is sufficient to solve the described tasks and user stories, enabling taxis to transport people between locations. However, it does not explicitly support multiple passengers per taxi or more complex constraints (e.g., destination goals, taxi capacity >1), which may be relevant in other user stories. Overall, the domain is robust and well-aligned with the scenario, with minor limitations in extensibility and edge case handling."
