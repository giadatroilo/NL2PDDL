    "Domain_Modeling_Score": 92,
    "Rationale": "The domain demonstrates an excellent understanding of the problem structure and PDDL capabilities. \n\n1) **Logic & Actions (Excellent):** The use of `forall` combined with conditional effects (`when`) inside the `set-true` and `set-false` actions is the optimal way to model SAT. It correctly propagates truth values to clauses immediately upon variable assignment, ensuring the state remains consistent. \n2) **Predicates (Good with minor issue):** The predicates cover all necessary entities. However, `(unassigned ?v)` is defined but constitutes dead code; it is never checked in preconditions (which correctly use negations of values instead) nor updated in effects. \n3) **Requirements:** While the logic is sound, the use of `forall` in effects technically requires the `:adl` requirement (or standard universally quantified effects support), which is missing from the header."
