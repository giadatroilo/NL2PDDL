  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 70,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (25/30): The predicates capture variable assignments (true, false, unassigned), clause membership (positive/negative), and clause satisfaction. However, 'unassigned' is not updated in the effects, so its utility is limited. Actions (25/35): The actions 'set-true' and 'set-false' allow assigning values to variables, with preconditions ensuring variables are only assigned once. The effects use conditional effects to mark clauses as satisfied if the assignment satisfies them. However, the model does not handle the case where a clause requires multiple literals to be satisfied (i.e., it marks a clause as satisfied as soon as any literal is set, but does not allow for unsatisfying assignments to be tracked or for clauses to become unsatisfied if all satisfying literals are missed). Sufficiency (20/35): The model is sufficient for simple SAT instances where each clause is satisfied by a single assignment, but it does not fully capture the need to check that all clauses are satisfied only if at least one literal is true in each clause. It also does not allow for unsetting or changing variable assignments, nor does it prevent over-satisfaction (e.g., a clause could be marked satisfied by multiple assignments). The model does not support more complex user stories such as backtracking or partial assignments. Overall, the PDDL captures the basic structure but lacks some common-sense and completeness for general SAT solving."
