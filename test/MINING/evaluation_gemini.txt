  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 100,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is an excellent and complete representation of the natural language scenario.\n1. Predicates (30/30): The predicates accurately and comprehensively model all necessary states of the environment. Key aspects like the robot's location (`robot-at`), the single-item inventory (`arm-empty`, `holding-laser`, etc.), item and obstacle locations (`laser-at`, `soft-rock-at`), and the map's topology (`connected`, `clear`) are perfectly captured.\n2. Actions (35/35): The action schemas are logically sound and align perfectly with the scenario's rules and common sense. Preconditions are correctly specified (e.g., `robot-at` for pickup, `connected` for destroying rocks). A key detail is modeled correctly: the distinction between a consumable bomb (the `destroy-soft-rock` action makes the arm empty) and a reusable laser (the `destroy-hard-rock` action leaves the robot holding the laser) is perfectly implemented in the effects.\n3. Sufficiency (35/35): The defined actions and predicates are fully sufficient to solve all tasks implied by the scenario, including navigating, clearing different types of obstacles, managing the single-item inventory by picking up and putting down tools, and ultimately collecting the gold."
