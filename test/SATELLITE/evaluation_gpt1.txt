  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 97,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain accurately models the satellite scenario as described. Predicates (30/30): All relevant properties—such as satellite pointing, instrument status, calibration, support for modes, and image requirements—are represented. Actions (34/35): The action schemas for turning, switching instruments on/off, calibrating, and taking images have logically sound preconditions and effects, including power management and necessary dependencies (e.g., must be pointing at the right direction, instrument must be powered on and calibrated). The only minor deduction is that the 'switch_off' action removes calibration unconditionally, which is reasonable but could be more nuanced if calibration could persist. Sufficiency (33/35): The domain is sufficient to solve the user stories implied by the scenario, including managing power, instrument status, and image capture. There is a slight deduction because the model assumes all calibration is lost on power-off, and does not explicitly model possible constraints like instrument warm-up or cooldown, but these are not required by the scenario. Overall, the domain is highly faithful to the natural language description and user stories."
