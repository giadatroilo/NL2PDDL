  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 100,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL specification is an excellent and complete model of the natural language description and user stories, earning a perfect score.\n\n1.  **Predicates (30/30 pts):** The predicates are comprehensive and accurately represent all necessary static and dynamic properties of the environment. Predicates like `(pointing ?s ?d)`, `(power-on ?i)`, and `(calibrated ?i)` correctly track the satellite's state. The use of predicates like `(image-requires ?img ?d ?m)` and `(image-data-available ?img)` to define and track specific, object-based goals is a robust and effective modeling technique.\n\n2.  **Actions (35/35 pts):** The action schemas are logically sound, with thorough preconditions that capture all necessary constraints and common-sense dependencies (e.g., a satellite must be `pointing` at a direction to `calibrate` or `take_image`). The effects correctly model state transitions, including resource consumption via the `(power-available)` numeric fluent. The modeling choice to have `take_image` and `switch_off` actions result in the instrument becoming uncalibrated (`(not (calibrated ?i))`) adds a realistic layer of complexity that is crucial for modeling the user stories accurately.\n\n3.  **Sufficiency (35/35 pts):** The defined predicates and actions are fully sufficient to represent and solve the tasks described in the user stories. The model can generate plans for taking single or multiple images, and the integrated power management ensures that resource constraints are respected. The domain successfully captures the operational logic required for a planner to find valid and efficient satellite operation schedules."
