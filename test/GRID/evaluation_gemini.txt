  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 100,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is an excellent and complete model of the natural language scenario.\n\n1.  **Predicates (30/30 pts):** The predicates are well-chosen and accurately represent all essential aspects of the environment. They correctly model the robot's location (`at-robot`), its inventory (`handempty`, `holding`), the location of objects (`at-key`), the map's topology (`connected`), and the properties of keys and doors (`key-shape`, `lock-shape`, `door-has-lock`, `unlocked`). The distinction between doors, locks, and shapes is a robust modeling choice.\n\n2.  **Actions (35/35 pts):** The action schemas are logically sound and adhere to common sense. The `move` action correctly requires the robot to be at the source location and the connecting door to be unlocked. The `pickup-key` action correctly requires the robot to be at the key's location with an empty hand. The `unlock-door` action's preconditions are comprehensive, correctly checking for the robot's location, that it's holding a key, and that the key's shape matches the door's lock shape. The effects of all actions accurately reflect the changes in the world state. The inclusion of a `drop-key` action, while not explicitly required by the scenario, is a logical counterpart to `pickup-key` and increases the domain's general applicability.\n\n3.  **Sufficiency (35/35 pts):** The defined predicates and actions are fully sufficient to model and solve the tasks described in the user stories. A planner using this domain can generate plans for navigating the environment, picking up keys, moving to a locked door, using the correct key to unlock it, and then moving through to the new location. The model is complete for the described problem scope."
