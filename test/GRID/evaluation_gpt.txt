  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 95,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain accurately models the scenario of a robot navigating a grid, picking up keys, and unlocking doors with matching shapes. The predicates comprehensively represent the necessary properties: robot location, key possession, key and lock shapes, door connectivity, and door status (30/30). The actions (move, pickup-key, drop-key, unlock-door) have logically sound preconditions and effects, enforcing that the robot must be at the correct place, possess the right key, and that doors must be unlocked before moving through them (35/35). The domain is sufficient to solve the described user stories: the robot can pick up and drop keys, unlock doors with matching keys, and move through the environment. The only minor omission is the lack of explicit modeling for multiple robots or more complex key/lock interactions (e.g., using a key multiple times or key destruction), but these are not required by the given scenario. Therefore, the sufficiency is nearly perfect (30/35)."
