  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 93,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain captures the Mars rover scenario with a high degree of fidelity. Predicates (28/30): The predicates accurately represent rover location, sample/image possession, tool state, waypoint connectivity, and communication, matching the NL description. Minor improvements could include explicit predicates for tool storage or rover power, but these are not strictly required by the scenario. Actions (33/35): Action schemas for navigation, sample collection, imaging, analysis, calibration, and communication are logically sound and enforce common sense (e.g., must be at a location, have the right tool, storage checks). Preconditions and effects are well-structured. Sufficiency (32/35): The domain is sufficient for the described user stories—navigating, collecting/analyzing samples, taking images, and communicating data. However, some edge cases (e.g., tool switching, handling full storage, or multi-rover coordination) are not explicitly modeled, which could limit extensibility for unlisted user stories. Overall, the domain is robust and well-aligned with the scenario, with only minor omissions."
