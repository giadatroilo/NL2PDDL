  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 100,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is an excellent and comprehensive model of the Mars rover scenario. \n\n1. Predicates (30/30): The predicates are exceptionally well-chosen, accurately capturing all critical aspects of the environment. They correctly model the rover's state (e.g., `rover-at`, `has-sample`, `equipped-with`), the properties of waypoints (e.g., `can-travel`, `can-communicate`), and the status of scientific objectives (e.g., `sample-at`, `analyzed`, `communicated`).\n\n2. Actions (35/35): The action schemas are logically sound, with robust preconditions and effects that align perfectly with the scenario and common sense. For instance, actions like `collect-sample` and `take-image` correctly require the rover to be at the target location. The model includes thoughtful details, such as the `take-image` action causing the tool to become uncalibrated, and the `communicate-sample-data` action requiring the sample to be `analyzed` first. The use of numeric fluents for storage management is implemented correctly and is crucial for the scenario.\n\n3. Sufficiency (35/35): The defined predicates and actions are fully sufficient to model and solve all tasks described in the scenario and its implied user stories. The domain supports complex plans involving navigation, resource collection, tool management (calibration), data analysis, storage management (including dropping samples), and communication. All core functionalities described in the natural language prompt are directly addressable with the provided actions."
