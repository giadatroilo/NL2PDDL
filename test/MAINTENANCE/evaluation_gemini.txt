  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 100,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is an excellent and complete model of the natural language description and implied user stories. \n\n1. Predicates (30/30 pts): The predicates are perfectly chosen. `(airplane-scheduled-at ?p ?a ?d)` precisely captures the core scheduling constraint. `(assigned-to ?m ?a ?d)` correctly models the dynamic state of a mechanic's location on a specific day. `(serviced ?p)` provides a clear and simple way to track progress towards the goal. Finally, `(next-day ?d1 ?d2)` effectively models the temporal aspect of the planning problem.\n\n2. Actions (35/35 pts): The action schemas are logically sound and well-defined. The `perform-maintenance` action correctly requires the mechanic and the airplane to be at the same airport on the same day, and that the plane has not yet been serviced. The `fly-mechanic` and `stay` actions provide a comprehensive and mutually exclusive set of options for a mechanic's state transition between consecutive days, correctly using the `next-day` predicate to enforce temporal progression. The preconditions and effects for all actions are accurate and sufficient.\n\n3. Sufficiency (35/35 pts): The defined predicates and actions are fully sufficient to solve the described problem. A planner can use the `fly-mechanic` and `stay` actions to position mechanics correctly over the planning horizon, and then apply the `perform-maintenance` action to achieve the goal of servicing all airplanes. The model can generate complex plans involving multiple mechanics, airports, and days, fulfilling all explicit and implicit requirements."
