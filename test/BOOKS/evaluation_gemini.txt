    "Domain_Modeling_Score": 45,
    "Rationale": "The domain fails to model the core requirement of 'parallel readings'. The `assigna-book` action explicitly prevents parallelism by enforcing `(not (is-occupied ?m))`, restricting each month to a single book. Furthermore, the `advance-after-reading` action advances the month after reading a single book; in a true parallel model, the agent should only advance after *all* books assigned to that month are read. There is also significant technical debt in the predicates: `can-read-parallel` is defined but never used (dead code), and there are three pairs of redundant/duplicate predicates (`read`/`is-read`, `next-month`/`next-m`, `assigned-in`/`assigned-to-read-in`), indicating poor cleanup and optimization."
