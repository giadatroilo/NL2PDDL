  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 100,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is an excellent and complete representation of the natural language scenario.\n\n1.  **Predicates (30/30 pts):** The predicates are perfectly modeled. They accurately capture all necessary states and relationships described: the location of the robot (`at-robot`) and objects (`at-object`), the connectivity between rooms (`connected`), the status of an object (`fixed`), and the robot's equipment and its state (`has-gripper`, `free`).\n\n2.  **Actions (35/35 pts):** The action schemas are logically sound and adhere to common sense. The `move` action correctly requires the robot to be at the source room and for a connection to exist. The `fix` action correctly enforces the common-sense precondition that the robot and the object must be in the same room to interact. It also correctly checks for the robot's gripper and the object's broken state.\n\n3.  **Sufficiency (35/35 pts):** The defined predicates and actions are fully sufficient to solve the tasks described in the user stories. The combination of `move` and `fix` allows a planner to generate solutions for navigating to any room with a broken object and repairing it, which is the core purpose of the domain."
