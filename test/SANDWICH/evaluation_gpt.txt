{ "Domain_Modeling_Score": 82, "Rationale": "Predicates are mostly well-defined, capturing allergies, locations, sandwich status, and tray contents, with some redundancy between 'on-tray' and 'holding-sandwich'. Actions for making, placing, moving, and serving sandwiches are logically sound and respect dietary constraints (e.g., only non-allergic children can be served gluten sandwiches). However, the model lacks explicit predicates or actions for children actually receiving or holding sandwiches (beyond 'has-been-served'), and does not model the possibility of serving the wrong sandwich type to allergic children (i.e., no negative effect for serving gluten to allergic children). The use of 'is-made' as a flag is reasonable, but its removal upon serving is questionable—this could cause issues if the same sandwich object is reused. The domain is sufficiently general for the described scenario, but could be improved by removing predicate redundancy, clarifying sandwich consumption, and more explicitly modeling the serving process. Overall, the domain is actionable and covers the main requirements, but minor logical and modeling issues prevent a perfect score." }
