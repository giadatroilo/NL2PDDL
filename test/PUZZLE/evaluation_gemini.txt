  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is a perfect and standard representation of the n-puzzle problem.\n- Predicates (30/30): The predicates are exceptionally well-chosen. `(at ?t ?p)` correctly tracks the position of each tile, `(blank ?p)` identifies the empty space, and the four `(adjacent-...)` predicates effectively define the static topology of the board. This set of predicates is both necessary and sufficient to describe any state of the puzzle.\n- Actions (35/35): The four `move-*` actions are flawlessly implemented. The preconditions for each action—requiring the tile to be at the source, the destination to be blank, and the correct adjacency between the two positions—perfectly capture the rules of the game. The effects accurately update the state by swapping the tile's position with the blank space's position.\n- Sufficiency (35/35): The model is fully sufficient to solve any n-puzzle problem. The predicates can describe any valid initial and goal configuration, and the actions provide the complete set of operators needed for a planner to find a sequence of moves to transition from the initial state to the goal state."
