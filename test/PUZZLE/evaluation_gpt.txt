  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 97,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain accurately models the n-puzzle environment as described. The predicates (30/30) precisely capture the necessary properties: tile positions, blank position, and adjacency relations for all four directions. The action schemas (34/35) are logically sound, requiring the tile to be at a position, the destination to be blank, and the positions to be adjacent in the correct direction; effects correctly update tile and blank locations. The only minor deduction is that the actions do not explicitly prevent moving the blank itself (though this is implicit in the design), and there is no explicit constraint to prevent moving a tile into a non-blank space (though the precondition covers this). For sufficiency (33/35), the domain is sufficient to solve all standard n-puzzle tasks and user stories, as it allows any legal tile move and can represent any board configuration. However, the domain does not explicitly model the goal state or constraints for illegal moves (e.g., moving non-adjacent tiles), but these are typically handled in the problem file or by the planner. Overall, the domain is highly faithful to the scenario and user stories, with only minor omissions."
