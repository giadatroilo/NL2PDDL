  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 100,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is an excellent and standard representation of the Sokoban problem.\nPredicates (30/30): The predicates are perfectly modeled. `(robot-at)` and `(box-at)` correctly track entity locations. `(clear ?l)` is crucial and correctly used to represent empty, traversable locations. `(adjacent)` effectively defines the static map layout, and `(is-target)` provides the necessary predicate for goal definition.\nActions (35/35): Both actions are logically sound and reflect common sense. The `move` action correctly requires the robot to be at the source location and the destination to be adjacent and clear, with effects that accurately update the robot's position and the `clear` status of the cells. The `push` action is also perfectly modeled, correctly requiring the robot to be adjacent to the box and the location behind the box to be clear. The effects correctly update the positions of both the robot and the box, as well as the `clear` status of the vacated and newly occupied cells.\nSufficiency (35/35): The domain is fully sufficient to address the user stories. The `move` and `push` actions directly enable the robot and box movement stories. The predicates `(box-at)` and `(is-target)` are sufficient to define the goal state where all boxes are on target locations in a corresponding problem file. The model is complete for this problem class."
