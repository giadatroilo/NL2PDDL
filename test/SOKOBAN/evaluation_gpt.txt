  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 92,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (28/30): The predicates accurately represent the robot and box positions, target locations, adjacency, and whether a location is clear, which are all essential for Sokoban-like reasoning. The only minor omission is that 'is-target' is defined but not used in any action, so its role in goal achievement is implicit rather than explicit. Actions (33/35): The 'move' and 'push' actions have logically sound preconditions and effects, requiring adjacency and clear locations, and correctly update the world state. They comply with common sense, such as requiring the robot to be at a location to move or push a box. Sufficiency (31/35): The domain is sufficient to solve the described tasks and user stories, including navigation and box pushing. However, the use of 'is-target' is not enforced in the actions, so the domain does not explicitly model the goal condition of boxes being at target locations, which could be relevant for planning. Overall, the domain is highly representative and functional, with only minor gaps in explicit goal modeling."
