{ "Domain_Modeling_Score": 95, "Rationale": "The PDDL domain accurately models the scenario: predicates are well-typed and non-redundant, capturing robot location, place connectivity, and visitation status. The 'move' action correctly encodes movement between connected places, updating both location and visitation. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit handling for already-visited places (e.g., 'visited' could be set regardless, but this is not problematic in STRIPS), and the absence of an explicit 'visit' action (though visiting is implied by movement). The domain is sufficiently general for any grid and robot, and all necessary capabilities are present for solving the 'visit all' task. No inverse or redundant actions are missing given the scenario. Overall, the domain is nearly perfect, with only minor room for improvement in explicitness." }
