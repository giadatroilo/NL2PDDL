  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 85,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (28/30): The predicates 'robot-at', 'connected', and 'visited' accurately represent the robot's location, the grid connectivity, and the visited status of places, which are all necessary for the scenario. Actions (30/35): The 'move' action correctly models movement between connected places, updating the robot's location and marking the destination as visited. The 'visit' action allows explicit marking of a place as visited, but this is somewhat redundant since 'move' already marks a place as visited upon arrival, which may not always be desired (e.g., if visiting and moving are conceptually separate). Preconditions and effects are logical and respect common sense (e.g., the robot must be at a place to move or visit). Sufficiency (27/35): The domain is sufficient to solve the user stories about visiting all places by moving through the grid. However, the dual mechanism for marking places as visited (in both 'move' and 'visit') could cause ambiguity or unintended behavior, and there is no explicit mechanism for handling multiple robots or more complex visitation constraints, which may be implied by other user stories. Overall, the domain is well-modeled for the core scenario but could be improved for clarity and extensibility."
