    "Rationale": "The generated PDDL domain is a flawless representation of the provided natural language scenario. \n\n1) **Predicates:** The predicates (`robot-at`, `visited`, `connected`) accurately and minimally cover all necessary state properties (location, history, and topology). \n2) **Action Logic:** The `move` action perfectly captures the dual nature of the task: navigating the grid and recording progress. By including `(visited ?to)` in the effects, it satisfies the requirement to mark places \"as it goes.\" \n3) **Sufficiency:** The domain allows for full traversability of a connected graph, ensuring that a planner can successfully generate a sequence to satisfy a 'visit-all' goal. The types and requirements are standard and correct."
