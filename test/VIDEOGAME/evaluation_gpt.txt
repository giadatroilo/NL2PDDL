  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 82,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (25/30): The predicates cover most of the necessary properties: locations of all objects, avatar's inventory, and grid relationships. However, orientation is only partially modeled (via up-of, etc.), and there is no explicit predicate for avatar orientation or for the state of the exit door (e.g., open/closed). Actions (30/35): The action schemas for movement, digging, pushing, picking up, and attacking are mostly logical and respect adjacency and preconditions. However, 'kill-crab' and 'kill-butterfly' only allow attacking upwards, which is a limitation not stated in the NL description. Effects for some actions (e.g., exit-game) are empty, which may be insufficient for goal achievement. Sufficiency (27/35): The domain is sufficient for basic user stories involving movement, digging, pushing, picking up, and attacking. However, it lacks handling for avatar orientation, possible interactions with walls, and more nuanced object states (e.g., boulders falling, exit door state). Some common sense implications (e.g., cannot move into a wall, cannot push two boulders) are not explicitly enforced. Overall, the model is strong but misses some details and generality required by the scenario."
