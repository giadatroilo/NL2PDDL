    "Domain_Modeling_Score": 70,
    "Rationale": "The domain captures basic navigation and manipulation but misses key semantic functionality described in the scenario. 1) Missing 'Mine Ore' Logic: The NL describes 'mining ore', but the PDDL only includes `break-rock` (which destroys a rock without producing ore) and `pickup-item` (which takes existing items). There is no mechanism to extract ore from rocks, rendering the 'mining' aspect incomplete. 2) Flawed Lift Physics: The `use-lift` action moves the `minebot` to the `to` cell but leaves the `lift` object at the `from` cell. Since the lift is a `physobj`, it should logically move with the agent. As written, the lift becomes stranded at the origin, preventing return trips. 3) Predicates: The type hierarchy is generally sound, correctly distinguishing rocks (obstacles) from items (holdable), but the lack of transition between them reinforces the missing mining logic."
