  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 70,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (25/30): The predicates capture the main properties (ingredients, assembled, packaged, delivered) relevant to ice cream orders, but lack granularity for order status (e.g., missing explicit tracking of all required ingredients or order completeness). Actions (30/35): The action schemas are logical and mostly follow common sense, enforcing correct sequencing (e.g., can't package before assembling), but do not model agent/location or resource constraints (e.g., who performs the action, where, or ingredient availability). Sufficiency (15/35): The domain is sufficient for the basic user stories of assembling, packaging, and delivering, but lacks predicates/actions for more complex or realistic scenarios (e.g., handling multiple orders in parallel, ingredient stock, errors, or partial assembly). Overall, the model is a reasonable abstraction for the core process but omits several practical and common-sense aspects needed for a robust solution."
