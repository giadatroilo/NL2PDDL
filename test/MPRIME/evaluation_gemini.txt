    "Domain_Modeling_Score": 55,
    "Rationale": "The domain attempts to mix two conflicting modeling paradigms: object-based resources (typical of the specific IPC 'Mprime' domain) and numeric fluents (standard PDDL 2.1), resulting in a confused and inefficient domain. \n\n1) **Redundant Predicates (15/30):** There are multiple pairs of inverse predicates (e.g., `location-has-fuel` vs `fuel-at-location`, `vehicle-has-space` vs `space-in-vehicle`) that represent the exact same state, requiring double bookkeeping and increasing the state space unnecessarily.\n\n2) **Action Logic & Semantics (20/35):** The `move-vehicle` action exhibits a critical logical flaw: it requires a `space` object at the destination (`?to`) in the preconditions but does not consume or occupy it in the effects. This implies that a single 'space' object at a location allows for infinite vehicle parking, violating the 'management of space' requirement. Additionally, the 'transfer-space' actions treat space as a movable commodity (like a container) which is a valid 'Mprime' interpretation, but mixing it with numeric `space-available` functions creates a disjointed hybrid model.\n\n3) **Resource Inconsistency (20/35):** The domain requires binding specific fuel/space objects to actions (e.g., `?f` in `move-vehicle`) while simultaneously managing numeric `fuel-level`. This limits generality, as the planner must find specific fuel objects just to decrement a number."
