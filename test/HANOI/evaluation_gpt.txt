  "Rationale": "Predicates (25/30): The predicates mostly capture the necessary properties: disc positions (on-peg, on-disc), disc status (clear), hand state (holding, hand-empty), and disc size ordering (smaller). However, the 'empty' predicate for pegs is not standard for Tower of Hanoi, as pegs can have multiple discs, and a peg is only 'empty' if it has no discs; this may complicate modeling stacks. Actions (30/35): The actions (unstack-from-disc, stack-on-disc, unstack-from-peg, stack-on-peg) are logically structured and enforce the rules: only one disc moved at a time, only the top disc can be moved, and size constraints are respected. However, the use of 'empty' in stack-on-peg and unstack-from-peg means only one disc can be on a peg at a time, which is incorrect for Hanoi (multiple discs per peg, stacked). Sufficiency (25/35): The model allows for moving discs between pegs and stacking/unstacking, but the 'empty' predicate prevents correct stacking of multiple discs on a peg, so the model cannot represent the full legal state space of the puzzle. Thus, while the model is close, it is not fully sufficient to solve all user stories or the general Tower of Hanoi problem."
