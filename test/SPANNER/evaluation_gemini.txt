  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 100,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is an excellent and complete model of the natural language description and user stories.\n\n1.  **Predicates (30/30 pts):** The predicates are perfectly designed. They accurately capture all necessary aspects of the environment: the locations of the man, spanners, and nuts (`man-at`, `spanner-at`, `nut-at`); the connectivity of the environment (`linked`); the state of the man (`holding-spanner`, `hands-empty`); and the properties of the objects (`is-usable`, `is-loose`, `is-tightened`).\n\n2.  **Actions (35/35 pts):** The action schemas are logically sound and fully align with the scenario and common sense. The `walk`, `pickup-spanner`, and `tighten-nut` actions directly implement the described capabilities. Their preconditions are correct (e.g., must be at a location to interact with objects, must have empty hands to pick up, must hold a usable spanner to tighten). The effects precisely model the state changes, including the critical detail that a spanner becomes unusable after tightening a nut (`(not (is-usable ?s))`). The inclusion of a `drop-spanner` action, while not explicitly mentioned in the scenario, is a logical and necessary addition for solving more complex problems like the second user story.\n\n3.  **Sufficiency (35/35 pts):** The defined predicates and actions are fully sufficient to model and solve the tasks described in the user stories. The first story, a simple sequence of walking, picking up, and tightening, is directly achievable. The second, more complex story requiring the use of multiple spanners for multiple nuts, is also solvable because the domain correctly models the one-time use of a spanner and provides the means (`drop-spanner`) to discard an unusable tool and acquire a new one. The model is robust and complete for the specified scope."
