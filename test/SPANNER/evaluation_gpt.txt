  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 95,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (28/30): The predicates accurately represent the scenario's entities and properties, including the man's location, spanner status, nut status, and connectivity between locations. The only minor omission is that 'hands-empty' is not strictly necessary given the 'holding-spanner' predicate, but its inclusion does not detract from correctness. Actions (34/35): The actions are logically sound and comply with common sense, requiring the man to be at the correct location to interact with objects, and ensuring the spanner is usable before tightening nuts. Preconditions and effects are well-modeled. Sufficiency (33/35): The domain is sufficient to solve the described user stories: moving, picking up, and using the spanner to tighten nuts, with the spanner becoming unusable after use. However, the domain does not explicitly model multiple men or spanners, nor does it handle reusing spanners or nuts beyond the described scenario, which slightly limits generality. Overall, the domain is highly faithful to the scenario and user stories, with only minor limitations."
