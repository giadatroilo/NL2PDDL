{ "Domain_Modeling_Score": 97, 
"Rationale": "The PDDL domain accurately models the environment for a tile-cleaning robot. Predicates: (at), (cleaned), and (adjacent) are sufficient and appropriate for representing the robot's location, tile cleanliness, and tile connectivity (30/30). Actions: The 'move' action requires adjacency and correct robot location, and the 'clean' action requires the robot to be on an uncleaned tile, both matching common sense and the scenario (35/35). Sufficiency: The domain supports all described user stories (moving in four directions, cleaning tiles, requiring adjacency), and the predicates/actions are sufficient for solving the cleaning task. The only minor deduction is for the inclusion of :types, which was explicitly not to be modeled, but this does not affect the logical sufficiency or correctness of the domain (32/35)." }
