  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is a perfect and standard representation of the natural language scenario.\n- Predicates (30/30): The predicates `(at ?r ?t)`, `(cleaned ?t)`, and `(adjacent ?t1 ?t2)` accurately and completely model the state of the environment: the robot's location, the cleanliness state of each tile, and the connectivity of the grid, respectively. There are no missing or superfluous predicates.\n- Actions (35/35): The `move` and `clean` actions are flawlessly defined. The `move` action correctly requires the robot to be at the source tile and for the destination to be adjacent, with effects that logically update the robot's location. The `clean` action correctly requires the robot to be at the target tile and for the tile to be dirty (`not (cleaned)`), which is a crucial common-sense precondition. The effects correctly update the tile's state to `cleaned`.\n- Sufficiency (35/35): The defined actions and predicates are fully sufficient to solve the tasks described. A planner can generate a sequence of `move` and `clean` actions to navigate to every dirty tile and clean it, thus satisfying all implicit user stories about cleaning the environment."
