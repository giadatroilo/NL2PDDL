  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 87,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (27/30): The predicates accurately represent the key properties: data stored on disk, loaded in RAM, and processed status. However, there is no explicit predicate for data being in transit or for modeling partial loads/transfers, which could be relevant for more complex user stories. Actions (32/35): The actions for loading, unloading, sending, processing, and deleting data are logically structured, with reasonable preconditions and effects. The use of numeric fluents for RAM, disk, and bandwidth is appropriate, but the send-data action's use of (/ (data-size ?d) 1024) for disk space is not clearly justified and may not align with the intended units. Also, network bandwidth is defined but not actually used in any action, missing an important aspect of the scenario. Sufficiency (28/35): The domain is sufficient for the basic user stories (loading, processing, sending, deleting data), but it does not model all common sense implications, such as bandwidth constraints on sending data, possible failures, or concurrent data transfers. The lack of explicit modeling for data transfer in progress or for bandwidth usage means some user stories (e.g., those involving network contention or transfer delays) cannot be represented. Overall, the domain is well-structured and covers the main requirements, but misses some important details for full fidelity."
