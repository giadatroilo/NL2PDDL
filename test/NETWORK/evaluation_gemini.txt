  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 65,
  "Rationale": "The domain successfully models the core entities (servers, data) and their primary states (stored-on-disk, loaded-in-ram, processed) with appropriate predicates and functions. The actions for loading, processing, and deleting data are logically sound and include sensible safety preconditions (e.g., data must be on disk to be loaded; cannot be deleted from disk while loaded in RAM). However, the model has several significant flaws. Firstly, there is a major unit inconsistency in resource modeling: RAM usage is based on `(data-size ?d)`, while disk usage is based on `(/ (data-size ?d) 1024)`, which is confusing and error-prone. Secondly, the natural language description explicitly mentions 'costs associated with each action based on... network bandwidth', but the domain completely fails to model this. The `(network-bandwidth)` function is defined but never used, and there is no cost metric (e.g., `total-cost`) to optimize. This makes the domain insufficient for any cost-based planning problems, which were implied by the scenario description. While the domain can solve basic state-transition user stories, it is an incomplete and flawed representation of the full problem."
