  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 78,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (24/30): The domain defines a rich set of predicates for elevator and passenger locations, door state, group memberships, and call status, which cover most of the scenario's needs. However, there is redundancy and unnecessary splitting between regular, VIP, and attendant passengers, which could be unified for clarity and maintainability. Some predicates (e.g., elevator-has-vip-passenger) are not clearly justified by the NL scenario and may complicate reasoning. Actions (28/35): The core elevator actions (move, open/close door, board/alight) are modeled with sensible preconditions and effects, enforcing that the elevator must be at the floor with doors open to board/alight. Group activation actions exist, but the actual constraints (e.g., never alone, conflict group) are not enforced in the action preconditions, so the model does not prevent illegal states (e.g., a never-alone passenger alone in the elevator). Sufficiency (26/35): The domain is sufficient for basic elevator operation and can represent group memberships, but it does not enforce the advanced constraints described in the scenario (VIP priority, never-alone, conflict avoidance) in the action schemas. Thus, while the structure is present, the logic to guarantee correct behavior for all user stories is missing. Overall, the domain is a strong starting point but lacks the enforcement of key constraints that are central to the advanced Miconic scenario."
