{ "Domain_Modeling_Score": 90, "Rationale": "The PDDL domain accurately models the scenario with well-typed predicates representing robot location, color possession, tile paint status, and adjacency, avoiding redundancy and excessive generality (30/30). Action schemas for moving, picking up/dropping color, and painting are logically sound, with appropriate preconditions and effects, and include cost accounting (33/35). The domain is sufficiently general for the described tasks, supporting multiple robots, colors, and directions, and allows for painting in any direction. However, there is a minor deduction: the 'drop-color' action is included, but the NL description does not specify whether robots can carry multiple colors or need to drop colors, and there is no explicit constraint preventing painting already-painted tiles with a different color (e.g., no check for 'not (is-painted ?paint_tile ?c2)' for c2 ≠ c). Also, the 'is-unpainted' predicate is used, but its maintenance relies on initial state and effects, which could be error-prone if not carefully managed. These are minor issues, so the model is highly faithful but not perfect." }
