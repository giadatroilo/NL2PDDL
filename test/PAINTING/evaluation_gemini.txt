    "Domain_Modeling_Score": 90,
    "Rationale": "The domain is well-modeled and correctly implements the core mechanics described in the scenario. \n\n1) **Painting Logic (Excellent):** The `paint` action correctly handles the 'directional' aspect by utilizing the `adjacent` predicate to allow a robot on one tile to paint a neighboring tile. It also correctly manages state transitions (`is-painted` vs `is-unpainted`).\n2) **Action Costs:** The domain correctly implements numeric fluents for `total-cost` across all actions.\n3) **Minor Semantic Looseness:** The `pickup-color` action allows a robot to acquire *any* color instance at *any* location without restriction (e.g., checking if a paint bucket is present). While this satisfies the requirement 'actions for robots to change colors', the semantics of 'pickup' imply an external object, whereas the implementation behaves like an internal switch or magic generation. Ideally, this would either be a `switch-color` action or require a `(color-available ?c ?t)` predicate. However, the domain is fully solvable and robust."
