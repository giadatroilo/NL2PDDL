  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 95,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain is a very strong and accurate representation of the natural language scenario.\nPredicates (25/30): The predicates effectively capture the state of the world, including the locations and states of the robot, cranes, and containers. A minor deduction is made for the `(liftable ?c)` predicate, which is redundant. Its state is always coupled with `(container-at ?c ?l)` in the `lift` and `place` actions, adding no new information and making the model slightly less concise than it could be.\nActions (35/35): The action schemas are logically sound and correctly model the described operations. The preconditions are well-defined, ensuring that agents (robot, crane) are at the correct location to interact with objects. The effects accurately reflect the state changes for all involved entities. The two-step process for loading (crane lifts, then loads to robot) and unloading (robot unloads to crane, crane places) is modeled correctly and robustly.\nSufficiency (35/35): The set of predicates and actions is fully sufficient to solve the core task of distributing containers. A plan to move a container from one location to another can be constructed by sequencing the provided actions (`lift`, `load`, `move`, `unload`, `place`), demonstrating the model's completeness for the described user stories."
