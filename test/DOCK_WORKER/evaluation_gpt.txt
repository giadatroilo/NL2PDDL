  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 92,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (28/30): The predicates accurately represent the key properties of the scenario, including the locations of robots, containers, and cranes, as well as the holding states and liftability of containers. The only minor omission is the lack of explicit modeling for container destinations or goals, but this is typically handled in the problem file. Actions (33/35): The action schemas are logically sound and respect common sense constraints, such as requiring the robot and crane to be at the same location to interact, and ensuring that only empty robots/cranes can pick up objects. Preconditions and effects are consistent and prevent impossible states. A minor deduction is due to the lack of explicit checks for container uniqueness (e.g., a container can't be held by both crane and robot simultaneously, but this is mostly enforced by effects). Sufficiency (31/35): The set of predicates and actions is sufficient to solve the described user stories, allowing for movement, loading, unloading, and crane operations. However, the model does not explicitly support more complex scenarios such as multiple robots or cranes coordinating, or container stacking, which could be relevant in a real dockworker scenario. Overall, the domain is well-modeled for the simplified scenario described, with only minor omissions."
