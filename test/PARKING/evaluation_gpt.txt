  "Rationale": "Predicates (25/30): The predicates 'parked-at-curb' and 'parked-behind' capture the essential relationships between cars and curbs or other cars, and the numeric fluents for available spaces are appropriate. However, there is no explicit predicate to prevent cycles (e.g., a car being parked behind itself, or circular chains), nor is there a predicate for whether a car is accessible for movement (e.g., not blocked by another car), which is a common-sense aspect in parking scenarios. Actions (30/35): The four move actions (curb-to-curb, curb-to-behind, behind-to-curb, behind-to-behind) are logically structured, with preconditions and effects that update the relevant predicates and fluents. However, they do not check for or prevent illegal moves such as moving a car behind itself or into a cycle, and do not model the need to 'unblock' cars that are behind others before moving them. Sufficiency (30/35): The model is sufficient to solve basic rearrangement and space management tasks as described, and supports action costs as required. However, it lacks the expressiveness to handle more complex user stories involving blocked cars, access constraints, or preventing cycles, which are common in real parking rearrangement scenarios. Overall, the model is strong for the basic scenario but misses some important common-sense constraints."
