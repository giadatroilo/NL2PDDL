  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 68,
  "Rationale": "The domain successfully models the core entities (cars, curbs, spaces) and the fundamental actions of parking and moving between different types of locations (curbs, behind other cars). The inclusion of a `total-cost` function correctly addresses the requirement for plan cost calculation. The action schemas are logically consistent with the defined predicates, for example, correctly checking if a destination space is available before moving a car. However, the model has two key weaknesses. First, the predicate design is inefficient and redundant; the abstract `location` type and its associated predicates (`car-at-location`, `is-curb-location`) add unnecessary complexity, and predicates like `curb-has-space` and `space-at-curb` describe the same static relationship. Second, and more critically, the model fails to capture the common-sense constraint of being 'blocked'. A car can be moved from a curb even if another car is parked behind it, which misrepresents the physical reality of a parking scenario. This makes the model insufficient for solving problems where obstruction is a key factor, which is a core aspect of this domain."
