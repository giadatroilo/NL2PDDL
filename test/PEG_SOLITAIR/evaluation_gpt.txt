  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 87,
  "Rationale": "Predicates (27/30): The predicates accurately represent the key properties of Peg Solitaire: peg positions, empty locations, adjacency, and move state. The use of 'move-active' and 'move-peg' supports sequential move modeling. However, the 'on-board' predicate may be redundant if only one board is modeled, and there is no explicit predicate for a peg being removed (though this is implied by the absence of 'peg-at'). Actions (32/35): The action schemas for 'start-move', 'jump', and 'end-move' are logically sound and enforce necessary preconditions, such as adjacency and emptiness. The 'jump' action correctly models the removal of the jumped peg and the movement of the jumping peg. However, the model does not explicitly prevent illegal multi-jump sequences or enforce that only one jump is allowed per move (if that is a rule variant), and the 'move' abstraction may be more complex than needed for standard Peg Solitaire. Sufficiency (28/35): The domain is sufficient to solve the user stories implied by the scenario: pegs can jump over others, pegs are removed, and the board state updates correctly. However, there is no explicit goal predicate for 'minimizing the number of pegs', and the model does not capture all possible board constraints (e.g., board shape, forbidden locations). Some edge cases (such as multi-jump moves or move legality in variants) are not fully addressed. Overall, the domain is robust and closely matches the NL description, with minor omissions and some over-modeling."
