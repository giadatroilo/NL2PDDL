  "Domain_Modeling_Score": 88,
  "Rationale": "The PDDL domain successfully captures the core mechanics of Peg Solitaire and is sufficient to solve the tasks described in the user stories, but its design is suboptimal due to an overly literal interpretation of the natural language description.\n\n1.  **Predicates (25/30 pts):** The fundamental predicates for the board state (`peg-at`, `empty`, `adjacent`, `on-board`) are correctly identified and modeled. However, the introduction of `move-active` and `move-peg` adds unnecessary complexity. These appear to be a direct translation of the NL phrase 'initiation... continuation... and ending a move', leading to a modal design that is not typical or efficient for this type of problem.\n\n2.  **Actions (28/35 pts):** The `jump` action itself is well-formed, with accurate preconditions and effects that correctly modify the board state according to the game's rules (e.g., moving the jumping peg, removing the jumped peg, and updating location statuses). The primary weakness is the overall action structure. The game is modeled with a three-action sequence (`start-move`, `jump`, `end-move`) for what is an atomic event. While this structure is internally consistent and could be interpreted as a way to model chain jumps, it is unnecessarily cumbersome and inefficient compared to a single, self-contained `jump` action.\n\n3.  **Sufficiency (35/35 pts):** Despite the design's complexity, the domain is fully sufficient to address the user stories. The predicates can define any initial board configuration, the actions correctly implement the jump mechanic required to play the game, and a planner using this domain could find a valid sequence of moves to solve a puzzle. The game's end condition (no more valid moves) is implicitly handled, as a planner would terminate when no actions' preconditions can be met."
